Some pairs of objects might be seen as being alternatives to each other (such as two pairs of jeans), while others may be seen as being complementary (such as a pair of jeans and a matching shirt). This information guides many of the choices that people make, from buying clothes to their interactions with each other. We seek here to model this human sense of the relationships between objects based on their appearance. Our approach is not based on fine-grained modeling of user annotations but rather on capturing the largest dataset possible and developing a scalable method for uncovering human notions of the visual relationships within. We cast this as a network inference problem defined on graphs of related images, and provide a large-scale dataset for the training and evaluation of the\u00a0\u2026", "total_citations": 2674}, {"title": "Learning to discover social circles in ego networks", "link": "/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=icbo4M0AAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=icbo4M0AAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "authors": ["Julian McAuley", "Jure Leskovec"], "publication_date": "2012-10-16", "conference": "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems", "pages": "539-547", "total_citations": 2587}, {"title": "Self-attentive sequential recommendation", "link": "/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=icbo4M0AAAAJ&pagesize=100&citation_for_view=icbo4M0AAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "authors": ["Wang-Cheng Kang", "Julian McAuley"], "publication_date": "2018-10-16", "conference": "International Conference on Data Mining", "description": "Sequential dynamics are a key feature of many modern recommender systems, which seek to capture the 'context' of users' activities on the basis of actions they have performed recently. To capture such patterns, two approaches have proliferated: Markov Chains (MCs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Markov Chains assume that a user's next action can be predicted on the basis of just their last (or last few) actions, while RNNs in principle allow for longer-term semantics to be uncovered. Generally speaking, MC-based methods perform best in extremely sparse datasets, where model parsimony is critical, while RNNs perform better in denser datasets where higher model complexity is affordable. The goal of our work is to balance these two goals, by proposing a self-attention based sequential model (SASRec) that allows us to capture long-term semantics (like an RNN), but, using an attention
